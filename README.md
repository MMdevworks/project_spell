## Game Design Document:

<b><u>Player Control</u></b><br>
>User controls a character with WASD or Arrow keys through 3rd person view in the 'hub' area


<b><u>Basic Gameplay</u></b><br>
>Within the hub area, player can visit different structures (representing categories) and be taken to a selection of related mini games to choose from.

<b><u>Sound & Effects</u></b><br>
>Non distracting background music within mini games; more playful in the hub. Sound effects for positive feedback. Sound clips provide auditory aid.

<b><u>Gameplay Mechanics</u></b><br>

>- Big picture overview: as player completes levels/lessons in minigames, they may unlock items within the hub; as they progress; their hub grows. 

>- MVP Spelling mini overview: On start, an image object appears on screen. Player is able to access an input field and must spell the word of the image correctly to move on to the next.

>- Additional features: Provide aid if the player is having trouble with correct spelling.

<b><u>User Interface</u></b><br>
>Buttons provide navigation across screens with ability for pause/resume. Screen UI in mini game will provide visual of words remaining and be used to provide visual aid.

<b><u>Other Features</u></b><br>
>Progressive story element
